    The plan was mars would take heavily (at least 90% reducdes) damage form all but one type and subtype at a time.
    This would require the group fighting him to bring all of:
    Slashing, piercing, blunt, h2h, ranged, fire, ice, lighting, wind, earth, water, light, and dark to every attempt.
    Mars would rotate weaknesses based on the party finding the correct damage types, gaining a different buff each time.
    Missing to many damage types would add reliance to that rotation take to long and the group would lose the battle.
    Each time Mars did a "mode switch" he woudl gaina spike effect signifying which element NOT to hit him with.
    This element would not match his cuurrent weaknedd. Ice spieks wpould not mean "use fire now".
    But casting the matching element would heal him. Ice spikes = absorbes ice.
    The party could only guess his physcical and magicical weaknesseds by feeding him TP from melee/ranged damage, and
    then watching what elemental blade attack he uses..Mars would NEVER use a blade that is weak vs his current spike effect.
    After they wore him down, players would see mars cease this rotation and gain permanant retaliation.
    At this point Mars would have no particula weakness and all resistances would
    even out at 50% his spell list changes and he could elemental blade at will.
